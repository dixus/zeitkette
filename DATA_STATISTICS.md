## Update History

### Major Additions
1. **October 2025 - Saturation Project** (+497 people)
   - Ancient period gaps filled (-27th to -1st century)
   - Medieval period saturated (3rd-14th century)
   - Temporal relations added for chain building

2. **September 2025 - Nobel Laureates** (~1,000 people)
   - All Nobel Prize winners added
   - Co-laureate relations created

3. **Initial Curation** (~400 people)
   - Core historical figures across domains
   - Focus on 15th-20th century

## Known Limitations

### Coverage Gaps
1. **Very Early Periods** (-32 to -20): Sparse (1-4 people/century)
2. **Bronze Age** (-19, -13 to -11): Limited (2-5 people/century)
3. **Music Domain:** Weak in ancient/medieval periods
4. **Non-Western Ancient:** Limited Chinese, Indian, African figures
5. **21st Century:** Only 3 figures (recency policy)

### Structural Limitations
1. **Eurocentric Bias:** 70% European/North American
2. **Gender Imbalance:** ~85% male (reflects historical record bias)
3. **Domain Imbalance:** Science/Politics dominate modern period
4. **Language Bias:** Prioritizes figures with multi-language Wikipedia articles

### Data Model Constraints
1. Relations stored by source person only (not bidirectional)
2. Relation types not fully standardized (multiple overlapping categories)
3. Confidence scores present but not systematically validated
4. Domain assignments subjective in border cases

## Future Enhancement Roadmap

### Planned Updates
1. **Geographic Expansion:** Add 50+ non-Western ancient figures
2. **Gender Balance:** Actively seek historical women (aim for 20% representation)
3. **21st Century:** Develop policy for recent/living figures
4. **Relation Enrichment:** Add 200+ medieval temporal relations

### Under Consideration
1. Bidirectional relation storage
2. Relation type standardization
3. Additional metadata (birth/death locations, occupations)
4. Image URLs from Wikimedia Commons

## Usage Recommendations

### For Timeline Visualization
- **Optimal Range:** -5th century BCE to 20th century CE
- **Minimum Threshold:** Filter to sitelinks ≥ 80 for clarity
- **Domain Focus:** Select 2-3 domains to avoid overcrowding

### For Chain Building
- **Start Period:** -6th century BCE or later (best connectivity)
- **Chain Types:** Use predecessor/successor for politics, teacher/student for philosophy
- **Validation:** Check temporal feasibility (no anachronisms)

### For Network Analysis
- **High-Density Periods:** 19th-20th century (Nobel network)
- **Intellectual Networks:** Ancient Greece, Islamic Golden Age, Enlightenment
- **Political Networks:** Roman Empire, Medieval dynasties
