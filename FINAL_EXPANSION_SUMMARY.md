## 📈 Coverage Improvements

### Before (Start)
- ~400 people
- ~95 with relations
- Strong 19th-20th century coverage
- Very sparse ancient/medieval

### After (Final)
- **1,853 people** (4.6x increase)
- **804 with relations** (8.5x increase)
- Excellent 19th-20th century coverage (1,361 people)
- **Vastly improved ancient/medieval**: 
  - Added 75 ancient/medieval figures
  - Added 134 ancient/medieval relations
  - Now 10-20 people per medieval century (was 1-7)

### Still Under-covered
Ancient centuries still have 1-16 people each (vs target of 30+):
- Very early periods (-23 to -12): 1-6 people per century
- Some medieval gaps: 7th-10th centuries still thin

## 🛠️ Technical Approach

### What Worked ✅
1. **SPARQL for structured data**: Nobel laureates query worked perfectly
2. **AI knowledge-based curation**: Reliable for ancient/medieval figures (Wikidata timeouts)
3. **QID-based deduplication**: Prevented duplicate entries
4. **Automated relation generation**: Co-laureate connections from award metadata
5. **Incremental expansion**: Build, verify, expand in phases

### What Didn't Work ❌
1. **Broad Wikidata SPARQL queries**: Gateway timeouts (504) for ancient period queries
   - **Solution**: Switched to curated lists using AI training data

### Scripts Created
1. `scripts/fetchNobelLaureates.cjs` - Nobel Prize winner fetcher
2. `scripts/addCoLaureateRelations.cjs` - Co-laureate relation generator
3. `scripts/reportCenturyCoverage.cjs` - Per-century coverage analyzer
4. `scripts/curatedCenturyFigures.cjs` - Manual century gap filler
5. `scripts/expandAncientMedieval.cjs` - Ancient/medieval expansion
6. `scripts/addAncientMedievalRelations.cjs` - Ancient/medieval relations
7. `scripts/consistencyCheck.cjs` - Data validation
8. `scripts/fillUndercoveredCenturies.cjs` - SPARQL fetcher (timeout issues)

### Data Files
- `data/people.json` → `public/people.json`: 1,853 people
- `data/relations.json` → `public/relations.json`: 804 relation entries
- `scripts/coverage_report.json`: Per-century gap analysis
- `scripts/consistency_report.json`: Data validation results
- `scripts/nobel_awards_cache.json`: Nobel laureate metadata
- `scripts/ancient_medieval_added.json`: Ancient/medieval additions log

## 🎯 Next Steps (Optional)

### To reach 2,500+ people:
1. **Fill very early periods** (-23 to -12 centuries):
   - Sumerian kings, Egyptian pharaohs
   - Ancient Chinese dynasties
   - Indus Valley civilization leaders

2. **Expand medieval gaps** (7th-10th centuries):
   - Byzantine emperors
   - Tang dynasty emperors
   - Viking leaders
   - Umayyad/Abbasid caliphs

3. **Add 21st century** (only 3 currently):
   - Contemporary politicians, tech leaders
   - Recent Nobel laureates (2015-2024)
   - Modern influencers and activists

4. **Enrich relations**:
   - More predecessor/successor chains for non-Roman leaders
   - Chinese dynastic successions
   - Islamic caliphate successions
   - European royal successions
   - More teacher/student in philosophy and science

5. **Geographic expansion**:
   - More African leaders (ancient Nubia, Ethiopia, West African kingdoms)
   - Pre-Columbian Americas (Aztec, Maya, Inca rulers)
   - Southeast Asian (Khmer, Thai, Vietnamese rulers)
   - Pacific/Oceanic leaders

## 📊 Impact

### For Temporal Chain Analysis
- **3,800+ year span**: From Sargon of Akkad (-2334) to Greta Thunberg (2003)
- **Dense 19th-20th century networks**: Nobel laureate clusters
- **Ancient philosophical lineages**: Complete Greek philosophy chains
- **Roman imperial succession**: Full emperor chains
- **Islamic Golden Age**: Scholar networks
- **Medieval scholastics**: Teacher/student chains

### For Visualization
- Rich enough for temporal network visualization
- Multiple concurrent chains across domains
- Geographic diversity for spatial analysis
- Popularity metrics (sitelinks) for node sizing
