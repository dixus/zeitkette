## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Explore Quantum Mechanics

```javascript
// Frontend code example
import { getChain } from '@/api/chains';

const quantumChain = await getChain('quantum-mechanics');
// Returns: 22 people with 34 connections
// Render as timeline or network graph

// Show Bohr's connections
const bohrConnections = quantumChain.people.find(p => p.qid === 'Q9047').relations;
// Returns: Heisenberg (student), Einstein (debated), Pauli (collaborated)
```

### Example 2: Find Path Between Two Artists

```javascript
import { findPath } from '@/api/paths';

const path = await findPath('Q7814', 'Q5603'); // Giotto → Warhol
// Returns: 
// Giotto → Masaccio → Leonardo → Raphael → Caravaggio → 
// Velázquez → Manet → Monet → Cézanne → Picasso → Warhol
// (11 steps, 750 years!)
```

### Example 3: Build Interactive Timeline

```javascript
<Timeline domain="classical-music">
  {composers.map(composer => (
    <TimelineFigure
      key={composer.qid}
      person={composer}
      onHover={() => showConnections(composer)}
      onClick={() => openDetailModal(composer)}
    />
  ))}
</Timeline>
